Notes:
  If the ESI-X script goes into an infinite loop, type the } key to interrupt it.
  Then type either GO. to resume or CANCEL. to go back to "command mode".
  Remember: All ESI-X commands MUST end with a period. (That's imperative.)

Copy and paste desired lines from this text file into the Windows console terminal window.
(If you don't have "QuickEdit Mode" enabled for the console window,
click the upper left icon in the window title bar and select Edit | Paste.)

Note that ESI-X sounds the "bell" (Control-G character) whenever it wants input 
(and displays an underscore).
If the bell bothers you, turn down your computer speaker volume.

If you enter text interactively, press Backspace to delete one or more prior characters.
Instead of moving the cursor and blanking the deleted characters,
an underscore is displayed for each backspace.
You will need to image what characters are left on the current line.
Remember, the earlier terminals were teletypewriters that printed on rolls of paper.
They didn't have "erasers".

To exit "politely", press Control-Break (or Control-E) to return to the SIMH command prompt,
then type BYE
To exit more quickly, just close the Windows console terminal window.
