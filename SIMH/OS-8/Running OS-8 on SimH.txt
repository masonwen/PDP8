1.3 PDP-8 OS/8

OS/8 is the PDP-8's mass storage-based operating system.  It provides a
program development and execution environment for assembler, BASIC, and
FORTRAN programs.  OS/8 is provided under license, as is, without fee, by
Digital Equipment Corporation, for non-commercial use only.  Please read
the enclosed license agreement for full terms and conditions.  This license
agreement must be reproduced with any copy of the OS/8 disk images.  My
thanks to Doug Jones of the University of Iowa, who provided the disk
images, and to Digital Equipment Corporation, which provided the license.

To boot and run OS/8:

	sim> att rx0 os8_rx.dsk
	sim> att rx1 os8f4_rx.dsk
	sim> boot rx0
	
	.DA dd-mmm-yy
	.

Note that OS/8 only recognizes upper case characters.  The first disk
(drive 0) is the system disk; it also includes BASIC.  The second disk
(drive 1) includes FORTRAN.
